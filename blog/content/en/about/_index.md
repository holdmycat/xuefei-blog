Hi, I'm Xuefei. I design and ship gameplay systems, Unity tooling, and performance-sensitive features. Recent work: combat and progression systems on **Ebonor** (Steam) plus the build/patch pipeline that kept IL2CPP stable.

This site collects production notes, experiments, and patterns that make designers faster and performance safer. When I'm not chasing frame time, I'm prototyping pipelines, integrating AI workflows, or writing small tools to keep teams unblocked.
