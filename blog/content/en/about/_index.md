Hi, I'm Xuefei. I design and ship gameplay systems, Unity tooling, and performance-sensitive features. This site collects notes from production work, experiments, and things I don't want to forget.

When I'm not chasing frame time, I'm prototyping pipelines, integrating AI workflows, or building small tools to keep teams unblocked.
