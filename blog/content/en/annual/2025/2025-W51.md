## This Week's Progress

### December 19, 2025 (Friday)

#### Army & Network Architecture Optimization

- ✅ **Team & Soldier Architecture**: Refactored `TeamID` to `Long` type and wired it with `Player/Faction`, establishing the Server-side single Team Seed initialization flow
- ✅ **NetId Routing System**: Implemented `NetId`-based RPC routing to ensure accurate command targeting for specific entities (Faction/Team)
- ✅ **SLG Data Foundation**: Introduced Attribute Graphs for Unit and Squad, laying the groundwork for combat stats and logic

### December 18, 2025 (Thursday)

#### Dual-World Architecture Core Implementation

- ✅ **FactionId Enum Refactor**: Converted `FactionId` from `int` to `FactionType` enum for improved code readability and type safety
- ✅ **Dual-World Framework**: Completed `ServerManager`/`ClientManager` initialization flow, ensuring Client listens before Server broadcasts

#### Faction Hierarchy System

- ✅ **FactionBase Shared Architecture**: `ServerFaction` and `ClientFaction` share a common base class for logical symmetry
- ✅ **Server-Driven Pattern**: Server drives Client-side view generation through `RpcCreateFaction`/`RpcCreateTeam`
- ✅ **IRoomManager Interface**: Unified contract between `ServerRoomManager` and `ClientRoomManager`

#### Deterministic Tick System

- ✅ **ServerTickManager Integration**: Drives logic layer at fixed 10Hz frequency
- ✅ **Tick Synchronization**: Client receives server frame numbers via `OnTickSync`

#### Documentation Enhancement

- ✅ **Demonstration Goals Refactor**: Clarified Demo focus on "rapid skill creation at scale"
- ✅ **Real-time SLG Skill Framework**: Designed skill system framework based on COK/War and Order best practices
- ✅ **Daily Review Workflow Enhancement**: Added weekly blog synchronization feature
