## This Week's Progress

### December 28, 2025 (Sunday)

- ✅ **UI Architecture (MVVM)**: Implemented Zenject-based MVVM framework supporting Nested UI (`CommanderInfoWidget`) and dynamic Factory creation.
- ✅ **Reactive Binding**: Resolved UI initialization race conditions via `OnCommanderAdded` event stream, ensuring data consistency.
- ✅ **Factory Method Practice**: Unified lifecycle management for Scene objects (via `Show()`) and Factory objects.
- 📅 **Tomorrow's Plan**: Proceed with Squad/Soldier entity generation and combat attribute integration.

### December 27, 2025 (Saturday)

- ✅ **Deep Architecture Refactoring**: Splitted SceneManager into `DualWorldSceneManager` (Generic) + `ShowcaseServer/ClientManager` (Content specific), decoupling framework from content.
- ✅ **Fixed Zenject Bindings**: Resolved Abstract Class circular binding issues and established best practices for Constructor Injection (Pure C#) vs Method Injection (MonoBehaviour).
- ✅ **Numeric System Upgrade**: Implemented `LevelUp` interface for `CommanderNumericComponent` and verified dynamic attribute changes via hardcoded logic.
- ✅ **Log Health Check**: Verified system startup/shutdown symmetry via Log Analysis Workflow, confirming no memory leaks.
- 📅 **Tomorrow's Plan**: Load `UIScene_ShowCaseScene`, connect Commander attributes to UI, and implement LevelUp/Downgrade operations.

### December 26, 2025 (Friday)

- ✅ **Commander Architecture Refactoring**: Completed Context Scope injection, achieving a self-contained dependency environment for Commanders.
- ✅ **Visual Configuration**: Implemented NodeGraph-based editor for Commander/Squad configuration.
- ✅ **Numeric Architecture Upgrade**: Introduced `NumericComponentFactory` for dynamic component attachment.
- ⚠️ **Plan Adjustment**: Squad generation postponed.

### December 25, 2025 (Thursday)

- ✅ **Dual-End Entity Spawning**: Completed SO-based Server/Client entity spawning.
- ✅ **Data Migration**: Migrated Player and Monster data to ScriptableObjects.
