- **Ebonor (Steam)** — atmospheric action adventure. I owned combat feel, progression systems, and the build/patch pipeline; shipped IL2CPP builds with deterministic skill runtime and editor tooling for designers.
- **FrameScope** — lightweight frame budgeting HUD for Unity, tuned for consoles. Displays CPU/GPU slice breakdowns and budgets by system.
- **AOT Guardrails** — build-time analyzer that flags reflection-heavy codepaths and suggests IL2CPP-friendly alternatives.
- **Pipeline Stitcher** — CI templates for Unity game builds across platforms with cache-aware artifact reuse.
